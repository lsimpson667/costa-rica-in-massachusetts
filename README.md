# Costa Rica En Massachusetts
Costa Rica En Massachusetts is a website that grows and engages the community of CostaRicans living in Massachusetts through social events, culture, food, art, sports, and other forms of entertainment.

The purpose of my website is to create a professionally appealing online presence for the Costa Rica En Massachusett Organization. There was a need for a central website where the organization could 
-	Advertise their events and provide resources for Costa Ricans living in Massachusetts


Graphic:
When the user enters my website, they can see the full homepage and the events page. However, I have also created an admin portal from scratch. Only administrators are able to login and use this part of the website. Pictures 2 - 5 are pictures of what the Admin Portal looks like. Picture 1 is the top of the home page of my website.

Setup:
This repo requires HTML, CSS, JS, MongoDB, Express, Node.js, and Bootstrap
